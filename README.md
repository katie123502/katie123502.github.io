**Note on MSA view:** The MSA plugin requires uploading a file containing the results of the MSA alignment. You can find these files in the jbrowse2 folder in the repo, and you can download and upload them to the static page to visualize alignments on the MSA viewer. You can also view the MSA alignment files via the default linear genome view without downloading/uploading yourself.

**Note on Protein Visualizer Plugin:** See the repo linked above for detailed instructions on how to use this plugin to visualize proteins.
